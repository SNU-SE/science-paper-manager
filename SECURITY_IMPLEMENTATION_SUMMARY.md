### 5. React Components and Hooks
- **Security Dashboard** (`src/components/security/SecurityDashboard.tsx`): Comprehensive security management UI
- **Security Hook** (`src/hooks/useSecurityManager.ts`): React hook for security operations
- **Admin Security Page** (`src/app/admin/security/page.tsx`): Administrative security interface

### 6. Testing Infrastructure
- **Comprehensive Test Suite** (`src/services/security/__tests__/SecurityService.test.ts`): Unit tests for all security functions
- **Integration Examples** (`src/app/api/example-secure/route.ts`): Demonstration of security middleware usage

  - Partitioned storage for performance
- **Audit Features**:
  - 90-day retention policy
  - Searchable activity logs
  - Security statistics and reporting

## Security Architecture

### Multi-Layer Security Approach
1. **Application Layer**: Middleware-based request validation
2. **Service Layer**: Centralized security service with comprehensive features
3. **Database Layer**: RLS policies and encrypted storage
4. **API Layer**: Secure endpoints with CSRF and session protection

### Key Security Principles Applied
- **Defense in Depth**: Multiple security layers
- **Principle of Least Privilege**: RLS policies and user-specific access
- **Secure by Default**: All endpoints protected unless explicitly configured
- **Audit Everything**: Comprehensive logging and monitoring
- **Fail Securely**: Graceful degradation with security maintained

## Performance Considerations
- **Database Partitioning**: Security logs partitioned by month for performance
- **Efficient Indexing**: Optimized indexes for security queries
- **Cleanup Automation**: Automatic removal of expired data
- **Caching Strategy**: Session and token caching for performance

## Deployment Requirements

### Environment Variables
```bash
ENCRYPTION_MASTER_KEY=your-32-character-encryption-key
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your-supabase-url
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your-service-role-key
```

### Database Setup
1. Run migration: `007_security_enhancement.sql`
2. Verify RLS policies are active
3. Set up automated cleanup jobs (optional)

### Application Integration
1. Apply security middleware to protected routes
2. Initialize security service in application startup
3. Configure session and CSRF settings
4. Set up monitoring and alerting

## Usage Examples

### Protecting API Routes
```typescript
import { securityMiddleware } from '@/middleware/securityMiddleware'

export async function POST(request: NextRequest) {
  const middleware = securityMiddleware({
    requireCSRF: true,
    logAccess: true,
    checkSuspiciousActivity: true
  })
  
  return middleware(request, {}, async () => {
    // Your protected route logic here
  })
}
```

### Using Security Hook in Components
```typescript
import { useSecurityManager } from '@/hooks/useSecurityManager'

function MyComponent() {
  const { storeAPIKey, getSecurityStats, secureRequest } = useSecurityManager()
  
  // Use security features in your component
}
```

## Testing Status
- ✅ Session management tests
- ✅ CSRF token tests  
- ✅ Activity pattern analysis tests
- ✅ Risk level calculation tests
- ✅ Security recommendations tests
- ⚠️ Encryption tests (require Node.js environment setup)

## Security Compliance
- **OWASP Top 10**: Addresses injection, broken authentication, sensitive data exposure
- **Industry Standards**: Follows security best practices for web applications
- **Data Protection**: Implements proper encryption and access controls
- **Audit Requirements**: Comprehensive logging for compliance needs

## Future Enhancements
1. **Two-Factor Authentication**: Add 2FA support
2. **Advanced Threat Detection**: Machine learning-based anomaly detection
3. **Security Metrics Dashboard**: Real-time security monitoring
4. **Integration with SIEM**: External security information and event management
5. **Automated Response**: Enhanced automatic threat response capabilities

## Conclusion
